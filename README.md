# MCP server + client weather example

## Running the example

Run the server and client using the following command:
```bash
uv run client.py ./server.py
```

Or to just run the server on its own:
```bash
uv run server.py
```

> When running the server from other locations (such as VS Code), you will need to use an absolute path to the `server.py` file.
